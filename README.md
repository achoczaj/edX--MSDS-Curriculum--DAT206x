[DAT206x Analyzing and Visualizing Data with Excel](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:Microsoft+DAT206x+1T2017/)

Excel is one of the most widely used solutions for analyzing and visualizing data. Beginning with Excel 2010, new tools were introduced to enable the analysis of more data, to improve visualizations and to enable more sophisticated business logic.

In this course, you will learn about latest versions of these tools in Excel 2016. You will see how to import data from different sources, create mashups between data sources, and prepare the data for analysis. You will learn about how business calculations—from simple to more advanced—can be expressed using the DAX calculation engine. You will also learn how the data can be visualized in Excel and shared to the Power BI cloud service.

The course is designed for self-paced study of around 2-4 hours per week for six weeks, including lectures, quizzes, labs and further readings. All quizzes and lab exercises are graded. The quizzes account for 30% of the total grade, the lab exercises accounts for 65% of the total grade, and the mandatory survey accounts for the remaining 5%. You must achieve an overall score of 70% to pass the course.
